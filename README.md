Our project goal was to build a hybrid recommendation system to recommend restaurants to users based on their Yelp reviews. In addition to finding restaurants that users may like, we also aimed to identify restaurants that users may dislike. We used a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to create recommendations. Specifically, our content-based filtering approaches used categorical data about businesses and textual data from reviews to help recommend restaurants based on what users actually like about a business. After aggregating the results from our individual algorithms, we were able to create a hybrid recommendation system and display our results using a Django-based web application.
